<h1> INTRODUCTION

<h2>This Python script automates the set-up and preparation of a laboratory based test called the Nijmegen Bethesda Assay.
<br></br>
<h2>Script accomodates the set-up of the Nijmegen assay set-up as outlined by the standardized operating procedures at St. Michael's Hospital. 
<br></br>
<h1>Reagent Calculator
<h2>Script accepts user input for number of samples to run. For each number of sample, accepts user input for demographics. From demographic entry, summation of dilutions for resource count. Calculates resources required then shows how much assay specific reagent to prepare.
<br></br>
Script will round up or down of required resource and calculate difference between that of the actual requirement and make recommendation of how many dilutions to add or remove.
<br></br>
<h2>Useful as the assay is quite resource expensive.
<br></br>
<h2>Features error checking.
